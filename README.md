# Window Walker (Fluent) for PowerToys Run

A powerful and fluent replacement for the classic Alt-Tab, built for [PowerToys Run](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/run).

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Fuzzy Search:** Quickly find the window you're looking for, even if you only remember part of its title.
*   **Live Previews:** See a live preview of the window before you switch. (Feature to be implemented)
*   **Seamless Integration:** Looks and feels like a native part of the PowerToys Run experience.
*   **Efficient:** Written in C# with a focus on performance to ensure it's always fast and responsive.
*   **Open Source:** Licensed under the MIT license.
